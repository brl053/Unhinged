# Phase 2 Completion Summary - gRPC Service Integration & Docker Orchestration

## Overview

Phase 2 has been successfully completed! We have implemented a complete gRPC-based audio processing system with proper Docker orchestration. The system now provides production-ready audio capabilities with streaming support and comprehensive monitoring.

## What We Accomplished

- Streaming TTS: `TextToSpeech(TTSRequest) returns (stream StreamChunk)`
- Streaming STT: `SpeechToText(stream StreamChunk) returns (STTResponse)`
- Voice management: `ListVoices`, `GetVoice` with pre-populated voice library
- Batch processing: `ProcessAudioFile` for file-based operations
- Health checks: Comprehensive service health monitoring

**Advanced Features:**
- Dual-mode operation: Both Flask HTTP and gRPC APIs running concurrently
- Whisper model loading with GPU support detection
- gTTS integration for text-to-speech synthesis
- Proper error handling and status reporting
- Resource management and cleanup

### ✅ **Kotlin gRPC Client Integration**

**WhisperTtsGrpcClient Implementation:**
- Complete implementation of `AudioProcessingService` interface
- gRPC channel management with proper connection handling
- Streaming audio processing using Kotlin Flow
- Proto message mapping with full type safety

**Streaming Capabilities:**
- TTS streaming: `Flow<AudioChunk>` output for real-time audio generation
- STT streaming: `Flow<AudioChunk>` input for real-time transcription
- Proper flow control and backpressure handling

├── prometheus (Metrics)           # Port 9090
└── grafana (Monitoring)           # Port 3001
```

**Production-Ready Features:**
