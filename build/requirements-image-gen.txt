# Image Generation Stack (Sovereign, No BS)
# Based on expert recommendations for RTX 5070 Ti with 16GB VRAM

# Core PyTorch (already in unified requirements but ensuring latest)
torch>=2.1.0                    # Core tensor operations and GPU compute
torchvision>=0.16.0            # Image processing utilities

# Efficient Model Loading and Storage
safetensors>=0.4.0             # Efficient weight loading, faster than pickle
huggingface-hub>=0.19.0        # Model downloading and caching

# Diffusion Pipeline Core
diffusers>=0.24.0              # Core diffusion implementation (HuggingFace)
transformers>=4.35.0           # Text encoders (CLIP, T5)

# Memory and Performance Optimization
accelerate>=0.24.0             # Memory management and multi-GPU support
# NOTE: xformers removed - incompatible with PyTorch 2.9.0+cu128
# Diffusers works fine without it (just slower). Can be added back when compatible version available.

# Configuration Management
omegaconf>=2.3.0               # Hierarchical configuration management

# Image Processing and Utilities
pillow>=10.0.0                 # Image manipulation and saving
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0          # Numerical operations (already in core)

# Optional but Useful
scipy>=1.11.0                  # Scientific computing utilities
matplotlib>=3.7.0             # Plotting and visualization
tqdm>=4.66.0                   # Progress bars for long operations

# Optional packages (commented out - add as needed)
# onnx>=1.15.0                   # ONNX model format support
# onnxruntime-gpu>=1.16.0        # GPU-accelerated ONNX runtime
# k-diffusion>=0.0.15            # Advanced sampling methods
# tensorboard>=2.15.0            # Training visualization
# wandb>=0.16.0                  # Experiment tracking
