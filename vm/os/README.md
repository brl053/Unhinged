# UnhingedOS Source Components

This directory contains the source components that make up UnhingedOS - the voice-first operating system built on Alpine Linux.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### `alpine-base/`
**Purpose:** Base Alpine Linux components and customizations
- Alpine Linux kernel configurations
- Base system packages and dependencies
- System initialization scripts
- Core Alpine customizations for UnhingedOS

### `unhinged-layer/`
**Purpose:** UnhingedOS-specific components and services
- Voice interface engine
- Natural language processing components
- Voice-first interaction handlers
- UnhingedOS system services
- Custom applications and utilities

### `boot-system/`
**Purpose:** Boot sequence and initialization system
- Boot loader configurations
- Init system customizations (OpenRC)
- Service startup sequences
- System initialization scripts
- Hardware detection and setup

### `graphics-stack/`
**Purpose:** Native graphics rendering system
- Native C graphics library
- DRM/framebuffer drivers
- SIMD-optimized rendering code
- Graphics memory management
- Hardware acceleration interfaces

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Adding New Components
1. **Identify Category:** Determine which subdirectory fits the component
2. **Follow Conventions:** Use consistent naming and structure
3. **Document Changes:** Update relevant README files
4. **Test Integration:** Ensure component works with build system

### Component Dependencies
- **alpine-base/**: Foundation for all other components
- **boot-system/**: Depends on alpine-base, initializes other layers
- **graphics-stack/**: Independent native C implementation
- **unhinged-layer/**: Depends on all other components

### Build Integration
Components in this directory are consumed by the build system in `../build/` to generate UnhingedOS images. Each component should:
- Be self-contained within its directory
- Provide clear build instructions
- Include necessary configuration files
- Support multiple build profiles

## üéØ Design Principles

### Voice-First Architecture
All components should support or enhance voice-first interaction:
- Voice command processing
- Audio feedback generation
- Hands-free operation
- Accessibility features

### Minimal Footprint
Components should minimize resource usage:
- Small memory footprint
- Fast startup times
- Efficient CPU usage
- Minimal dependencies

### Security by Design
All components should follow security best practices:
- Principle of least privilege
- Input validation
- Secure defaults
- Minimal attack surface
