@llm-does UnhingedOS system architecture documentation and design specifications for voice-first operating system built on Alpine Linux foundation
@llm-type architecture.system/unhinged-os-design
@llm-context UnhingedOS Architecture & Vision: UnhingedOS represents a paradigm shift from traditional desktop computing to voice-first interaction. Complete operating system where voice is primary interface, visual elements serve as feedback mechanisms, optimized for natural conversational computing. High-Level Architecture: Host System containing UnhingedOS VM with Voice Interface Layer, Native Graphics Stack, Boot System over Alpine Linux Base, connected via 9p virtio Communication. Core Components: (1) Alpine Linux Foundation - Alpine Linux 3.22.2 base system, APK package manager with minimal package set, OpenRC init system for service management, hardened kernel with minimal attack surface, 64MB base footprint, (2) Voice Interface Layer - natural language command processing, integrated speech-to-text engine, text-to-speech feedback system, intent recognition and action mapping, conversation state and history management, (3) Native Graphics Stack - direct hardware access via DRM/framebuffer without abstraction, SIMD-optimized rendering (AVX2, NEON, SSE4.2), zero-allocation memory pool management, hardware-accelerated compositing, custom graphics library with performance optimization, (4) Boot System - custom boot sequence optimized for voice-first interaction, service orchestration for voice components, hardware detection and initialization, graphics system startup coordination, (5) Communication Layer - 9p virtio filesystem for host-VM communication, secure data exchange protocols, shared directory mounting, bidirectional message passing, (6) Security Architecture - complete VM isolation boundary, minimal attack surface through Alpine base, secure communication protocols, memory safety in native C components, reproducible build process. Technical Specifications: Base System (Alpine Linux 3.22.2, musl libc, BusyBox utilities, OpenRC init), Voice Processing (speech recognition engine, natural language processing, voice synthesis, audio device management), Graphics Rendering (direct framebuffer access, DRM driver integration, SIMD optimization, memory management), Virtualization (QEMU/KVM hypervisor, hardware acceleration, 9p virtio filesystem, network isolation), Development (systematic build pipeline, profile-based configuration, comprehensive testing framework, reproducible builds). Performance Characteristics: Boot time under 10 seconds, voice response latency under 200ms, memory footprint 64-512MB depending on profile, graphics rendering 60+ FPS, minimal CPU overhead for voice processing.
