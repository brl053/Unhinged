@llm-context UnhingedOS Build System: Transforms source components into bootable operating system images through systematic, profile-based approach. Build Pipeline: Source Components (os/ directory) → Profile Selection (build/profiles/) → Alpine Customization (package selection) → ISO Generation (bootable ISO) → VM Image (QCOW2 format). Directory Structure: os/ (alpine-base - Base Alpine Linux components, unhinged-layer - UnhingedOS-specific layer, boot-system - Boot and init system, graphics-stack - Native graphics system), build/ (unhinged-os-builder.sh - Master OS builder, os-configurator.sh - OS configuration script, profiles/ - Build profiles for minimal/desktop/server/dev), runtime/ (images/ - VM disk images .qcow2, isos/ - Bootable ISOs, shared/ - Host-VM communication), testing/ (boot-tests - Boot sequence validation, graphics-tests - Graphics system testing, integration-tests - Full system testing). Build Profiles: (1) Minimal Profile (64MB RAM) - Alpine Linux base 32MB, Voice interface engine 16MB, Basic graphics stack 16MB, Essential services only, Use cases: embedded systems, IoT devices, resource-constrained environments, voice-only interfaces, (2) Desktop Profile (256MB RAM) - Complete voice interface 64MB, Full graphics stack with compositing 128MB, Desktop services and utilities 64MB, Multi-application support, Use cases: primary desktop replacement, voice-controlled workstations, accessibility-focused computing, demonstration systems, (3) Server Profile (128MB RAM) - Voice processing engine 96MB, Network services 16MB, Minimal graphics 16MB, Server utilities, Use cases: voice processing backend, API server for voice services, distributed voice computing, cloud deployments, (4) Development Profile (512MB RAM) - Complete development toolchain 256MB, Debugging and profiling tools 128MB, Full graphics and voice stack 128MB, Use cases: UnhingedOS development, system debugging, performance analysis, research platform. Build Commands: make unhinged-os-minimal (core voice-first OS), make unhinged-os-desktop (full desktop environment), make unhinged-os-server (headless server variant), make unhinged-os-dev (development environment). Development Workflow: source development in os/, build process with build/ tools, comprehensive testing in testing/, deployment artifacts in runtime/. Build Configuration: profile-based package selection, service configuration, kernel customization, system optimization, image generation with bootable ISO creation, QCOW2 VM image generation, optimization and compression, artifact placement in runtime/.
