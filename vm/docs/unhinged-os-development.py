@llm-context UnhingedOS Development Workflow: Complete development environment for voice-first operating system. Testing Framework Structure: (1) boot-tests/ - Boot sequence and initialization validation (boot time measurement, service startup verification, hardware detection testing, init system validation, kernel parameter testing), (2) graphics-tests/ - Native graphics system validation (framebuffer functionality, DRM driver testing, SIMD optimization validation, memory pool testing, rendering correctness), (3) voice-tests/ - Voice interface system validation (speech recognition accuracy, voice synthesis quality, command processing latency, natural language understanding, audio device compatibility), (4) integration-tests/ - Full system integration testing (end-to-end workflow validation, component interaction testing, system resource usage, multi-service coordination, real-world scenario testing), (5) performance-tests/ - System performance benchmarking (boot time benchmarks, memory usage profiling, CPU utilization analysis, voice latency measurement, graphics performance testing), (6) system-tests/ - Core system functionality testing (file system operations, process management, network connectivity, service management). Image Management: Systematic VM image naming with unhinged-os-{profile}.{format} conventions, Image lifecycle management (build process, image operations, testing & validation), Version management (versioned backups, symlink management, archival strategies), Storage optimization (compression, cleanup procedures). Runtime Artifacts: images/ (QCOW2 virtual machine disk images), isos/ (bootable ISO images), shared/ (host-VM communication interfaces). Development Guidelines: Voice-First principle (all features must support voice interaction), Minimal Overhead (justify every dependency and service), Native Performance (prefer C implementations over frameworks), Security by Design (consider isolation and attack surface), Reproducible builds (all builds must be deterministic). Contributing Workflow: identify category for new components, follow consistent naming and structure, document changes in relevant files, test integration with build system. Component Dependencies: alpine-base (foundation for all other components), boot-system (depends on alpine-base, initializes other layers), graphics-stack (independent native C implementation), unhinged-layer (depends on all other components). Security Model: VM isolation through complete hardware virtualization boundary, minimal attack surface via Alpine Linux minimal base, secure communication through controlled host-VM data exchange, memory safety via native C with careful memory management, reproducible builds through deterministic build process.
