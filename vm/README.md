# UnhingedOS - Voice-First Operating System

UnhingedOS is a custom Linux distribution built on Alpine Linux, designed from the ground up for **voice-first interaction** and **native graphics performance**. It represents a fundamental shift from traditional desktop paradigms to natural, conversational computing.

## 🎯 Philosophy

**Voice-First Computing:** The primary interface is voice interaction, with visual elements serving as feedback and enhancement rather than the main interaction method.

**Minimal Foundation:** Built on Alpine Linux for security, performance, and minimal resource footprint.

**Native Performance:** Direct hardware access through C graphics libraries, bypassing bloated frameworks.

**Isolation by Design:** Complete virtualization boundary for security and system integrity.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **Base System:** Alpine Linux 3.22.2 (minimal, security-focused)
- **Graphics Stack:** Native C with DRM/framebuffer direct access
- **Voice Interface:** Primary interaction method with visual feedback
- **Communication:** 9p virtio filesystem for host integration
- **Virtualization:** QEMU/KVM with hardware acceleration

### Design Principles

1. **Voice-First:** All interactions designed for voice commands
2. **Minimal Overhead:** No unnecessary services or frameworks
3. **Direct Hardware Access:** Native C graphics without abstraction layers
4. **Security Isolation:** Complete VM boundary for untrusted operations
5. **Reproducible Builds:** Deterministic OS generation from source

## 🚀 Key Features

### Voice-First Interface
- Natural language command processing
- Voice feedback and confirmation
- Visual elements as status indicators
- Hands-free operation capability

### Native Graphics Performance
- Direct DRM/framebuffer access
- SIMD-optimized rendering (AVX2, NEON)
- Memory pool management for zero-allocation rendering
- Hardware-accelerated compositing

### Security & Isolation
- Complete VM boundary from host system
- Minimal attack surface through Alpine base
- Isolated graphics rendering environment
- Secure host-VM communication protocols

### Development Features
- Live development environment
- Hot-reload capability for graphics changes
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Multiple build profiles (minimal, desktop, server, dev)

## 📦 Build Profiles

UnhingedOS supports multiple build configurations:

- **Minimal:** Core voice interface, basic graphics (64MB RAM)
- **Desktop:** Full voice-first desktop environment (256MB RAM)
- **Server:** Headless voice processing server (128MB RAM)
- **Development:** Full development tools and debugging (512MB RAM)

## 🛠️ Build System

```bash
# Build different OS variants
make unhinged-os-minimal     # Minimal voice-first OS
make unhinged-os-desktop     # Full desktop environment
make unhinged-os-server      # Headless server variant
make unhinged-os-dev         # Development environment

# Quick development cycle
make vm-start                # Start development VM
make vm-test                 # Run integration tests
make vm-deploy               # Deploy to production
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. **Source Development:** Modify OS components in `os/` directory
2. **Build Process:** Use `build/` tools to generate OS images
3. **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite in `testing/` directory
4. **Deployment:** Runtime artifacts in `runtime/` directory
