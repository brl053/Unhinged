I am referring to Robert Temple's \"Templos\" series, a science fiction animated television series that aired from 1990 to 1991.\n\nAs the creator of Templos, which was later adapted into an animated film called \"Temple of Doom\", you are likely Terry Davis, a renowned animation director and producer.",
