### Our Way
We build not just code, but **legends** for future travelers. Every tool is a **key**, every document a **map**. We stand on the shoulders of giants and extend the ladder for those who follow.

### Our Code
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Write for the LLM that reads this tomorrow
- **Simplicity over complexity** - The best solution is often the simplest
- **Excellence over expedience** - Do it right, or do it again
- **Documentation as love** - Future you will thank present you

### Our Commitment
*"The way of the warrior is to stop trouble before it starts."* - **Miyamoto Musashi**

We prevent problems through:
- Clear documentation
- Consistent patterns  
- Thoughtful architecture
- Wisdom-guided decisions

*"In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends."* - **Martin Luther King Jr.**

Let this wisdom guide every commit, every function, every decision. We are not just building software - we are crafting a legacy.
