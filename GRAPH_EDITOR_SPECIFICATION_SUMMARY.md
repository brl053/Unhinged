### 3. Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**
- Generate GTK4 components from specs
- Implement canvas rendering with Cairo
- Create graph workspace view in GTK4 UI

**Phase 2: Core Editing (Week 3-4)**
- Render nodes on canvas
- Render edges between nodes
- Implement edge creation

**Phase 3: Integration (Week 5-6)**
- Document store integration (save/load)
- Graph service integration (execution)
- Node palette

**Phase 4: Polish (Week 7-8)**
- Undo/redo
- Multi-select and copy/paste
- Auto-layout
- Minimap

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Specification-First Approach
- YAML specifications are the source of truth
- Implementations are generated from specs
- Same specs work for GTK4, React, and future platforms

### 2. Component Hierarchy
```
graph-canvas (complex)
├── graph-node (complex)
│   └── graph-port (primitive)
├── graph-edge (primitive)
└── graph-toolbar (container)
```

### 3. Data Model
- **Nodes**: Represent operations/services with unique IDs, types, positions, and configuration
- **Edges**: Represent connections with source/target references and port names
- **Viewport**: Manages pan (x, y) and zoom (0.1 to 4.0)

### 4. Integration Points
- **Graph Service**: Nodes map to NodeType enum, graphs match protobuf structure
- **Document Store**: Graphs serialized to protobuf for persistence
- **Design System**: Components use design tokens for styling

## Platform Portability

These specifications are designed to generate implementations for:

1. **GTK4** (Current) - Desktop Linux/Windows
2. **React** (Future) - Web interface
3. **Mobile** (Future) - React Native or Flutter

The same YAML specifications should work for all platforms with platform-specific code generation.

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Graph Service (`proto/graph_service.proto`)
- Node types map to `NodeType` enum (speech_to_text, llm_chat, etc.)
- Graph structure matches `Graph` protobuf message
- Execution status reflects service state

### Document Store (`proto/document_store.proto`)
- Graphs stored as documents with metadata + body
- Automatic versioning with each update
- Tag-based version management

### Design System (`libs/design_system/`)
- Components use design tokens for styling
- Generated code follows component generation patterns
- Accessibility requirements built-in

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Review specifications** - Ensure they match your vision
2. **Validate component generation** - Test if generator can handle these specs
3. **Prototype canvas rendering** - Validate GTK4 Cairo approach

### Short-term (Next 2-3 Weeks)
1. **Phase 1 delivery** - Working graph workspace with functional canvas
2. **Integration test** - Create node, save to document store, retrieve
3. **Validation test** - Graph service correctly rejects invalid graphs

### Performance Validation
- Create 100 dummy nodes on canvas
- Measure pan/zoom responsiveness
- If sluggish, implement viewport culling

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete
- ✅ Graph workspace tab appears in GTK4 UI
- ✅ Canvas renders with pan/zoom support
- ✅ Grid snapping works
- ✅ Toolbar is functional

### Phase 2 Complete
- ✅ Nodes render and are selectable
- ✅ Edges render between nodes
- ✅ Nodes can be dragged
- ✅ Edges can be created by dragging between ports

### Phase 3 Complete
- ✅ Graphs can be saved to document store
- ✅ Graphs can be loaded from document store
- ✅ Graphs can be executed via graph service
- ✅ Execution status updates in real-time

### Phase 4 Complete
- ✅ Undo/redo works for all operations
- ✅ Multi-select and copy/paste work
- ✅ Auto-layout produces readable graphs
- ✅ Minimap enables navigation

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Component Generation**: Can your component generator handle `custom` layout types?
2. **Gesture Interactions**: How should drag, zoom, and other gestures be represented in YAML?
3. **Cairo Rendering**: Should rendering hints be in the spec or left to implementation?
4. **Node Types**: Should node type definitions be separate component specs?
5. **Performance**: What's the target for maximum nodes before viewport culling is needed?

## Conclusion

The graph editor specification is complete and ready for implementation. The specification-first approach ensures:

- ✅ Clear requirements before coding
- ✅ Platform portability from day one
- ✅ Consistency across implementations
- ✅ Easy to extend with new features
- ✅ Testable at specification level

The 8-week implementation roadmap provides clear milestones and deliverables. Start with Phase 1 to validate the approach, then proceed through phases 2-4 for a complete, production-ready graph editor.
