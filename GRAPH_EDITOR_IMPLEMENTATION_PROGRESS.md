## Architecture Overview

### Component Hierarchy

```
GraphWorkspaceView (Workspace Controller)
├── Toolbar (Zoom, Grid, Actions)
├── GraphCanvasWidget (Cairo Canvas)
│   ├── Viewport (Pan/Zoom State)
│   ├── Nodes (Rendering & Interaction)
│   ├── Edges (Bezier Curves & Arrows)
│   └── Grid (Background)
└── StatusBar (Real-time Updates)
```

### Rendering Pipeline

```
1. Clear Background
2. Draw Grid (if enabled)
3. Draw Edges (with bezier curves)
4. Draw Nodes (with status indicators)
5. Draw Selection Highlight
```

### Interaction Model

```
Mouse Events:
├── Click → Select/Deselect Node
├── Drag → Move Node or Pan Canvas
└── Scroll → Zoom In/Out

Gestures:
├── Drag Gesture → Node Movement
├── Scroll Gesture → Viewport Zoom
└── Motion Controller → Hover Detection
```
