# Design System Typography Tokens - Constraint System
# Based on designer specifications: 5 type sizes, 3 weights, 2 font families maximum
#
# Typography Contract:
# - Five sizes maximum (display, heading, body, caption, code)
# - Three weights (regular, medium, bold)
# - Two families maximum (prose, code)
# - Tightness inversely correlates with size
#
# Usage: typography.display, typography.body, typography.code

# FONT FAMILY SYSTEM (2 families maximum)
typography:
  families:
    # Prose family - For display, heading, body, caption
    prose:
      - "Inter"
      - "-apple-system"
      - "BlinkMacSystemFont"
      - "Segoe UI"
      - "Roboto"
      - "Helvetica Neue"
      - "Arial"
      - "sans-serif"

    # Code family - For monospace content only
    code:
      - "JetBrains Mono"
      - "Fira Code"
      - "SF Mono"
      - "Monaco"
      - "Menlo"
      - "Courier New"
      - "monospace"

# TYPE SCALE SYSTEM (5 sizes exactly)
  scale:
    # Display - Page titles, hero text (largest, highest hierarchy, rare use)
    display:
      family: "prose"
      size: "2.25rem"        # 36px
      weight: "bold"         # 700
      line_height: "tight"   # 1.2x
      letter_spacing: "tight" # -0.02em

    # Heading - Section headers, major content grouping
    heading:
      family: "prose"
      size: "1.5rem"         # 24px
      weight: "medium"       # 500 (or bold for primary sections)
      line_height: "tight"   # 1.2x
      letter_spacing: "normal" # 0em

    # Body - Default paragraph text, form labels, list items (maximum readability)
    body:
      family: "prose"
      size: "1rem"           # 16px
      weight: "regular"      # 400
      line_height: "normal"  # 1.5x
      letter_spacing: "normal" # 0em

    # Caption - Annotations, metadata, timestamps, helper text
    caption:
      family: "prose"
      size: "0.875rem"       # 14px
      weight: "regular"      # 400
      line_height: "loose"   # 1.6x (ensures readability at small sizes)
      letter_spacing: "loose" # 0.04em (optional, increases scannability)

    # Code - Monospaced content, code blocks, terminal output
    code:
      family: "code"
      size: "0.875rem"       # 14px
      weight: "regular"      # 400
      line_height: "code"    # 1.5x
      letter_spacing: "normal" # 0em

# WEIGHT SYSTEM (3 weights exactly)
  weights:
    regular: 400    # Default, body text, neutral
    medium: 500     # Light emphasis, labels, secondary headers
    bold: 700       # Strong emphasis, primary headers, bold text

# LINE HEIGHT SYSTEM (tightness inversely correlates with size)
  line_heights:
    tight: 1.2     # Applied to display, heading (larger text needs less space)
    normal: 1.5    # Applied to body (default)
    loose: 1.6     # Applied to caption (smaller text needs more space)
    code: 1.5      # Applied to code (consistent structure)

# LETTER SPACING SYSTEM (minimal, used selectively)
  letter_spacing:
    tight: "-0.02em"   # Applied to display (luxury compact feel)
    normal: "0em"      # Default for all
    loose: "0.04em"    # Applied to caption (optional, increases scannability)

# APPLICATION PATTERNS (how to apply the 5 type sizes)
  patterns:
    # Display usage
    display_usage:
      - "Page titles"
      - "Hero text"

# PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS
# GTK4 uses Pango font descriptions - these map semantic tokens to platform formats
platforms:
  gtk4:
    # Map semantic tokens to Pango font descriptions
    display: "Inter Bold 24"      # typography.display
    heading: "Inter Medium 16"    # typography.heading
    body: "Inter 12"              # typography.body
    caption: "Inter 11"           # typography.caption
    code: "JetBrains Mono 11"     # typography.code

  # Future platform mappings can be added here
  # web: CSS font properties
  # mobile: platform-specific font sizing
